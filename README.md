# Modelling Kidney Stone Presence Prediction using Urine Analysis #
This repository contains the data and code for predicting the presence of kidney stones based on urine analysis. 
The dataset used for this modelling project was sourced from Springer and consists of 79 urine specimens. 
The goal of this analysis was to investigate whether certain physical characteristics of urine are related to the formation of calcium oxalate crystals, which are commonly found in kidney stones.

# Dataset Description
The dataset provided by Springer contains the following six physical characteristics of urine:

Specific Gravity: The density of the urine relative to water.
pH: The negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration, indicating the acidity or alkalinity of the urine.
Osmolarity (mOsm): A unit used in biology and medicine to measure the concentration of solute particles in a solution.
pHd: A pH value used in the dataset that is not typically used in the field of urine analysis.
Calcium (mmol/L): The concentration of calcium in urine, measured in millimoles per liter.
Magnesium (mmol/L): The concentration of magnesium in urine, measured in millimoles per liter.
Each urine specimen in the dataset is labeled as either "Kidney Stone Present" or "Kidney Stone Absent," indicating the presence or absence of kidney stones.

# Modelling Approach
To predict the presence of kidney stones based on urine analysis, Exploratory Data Analysis was performed then several machine learning models were trained on the dataset. 
The specific details of the modelling approach and the algorithms used can be found in the code file in this repository.
